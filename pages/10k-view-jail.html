                    You're consistently hitting strong view counts, but growth has stalled at a certain ceiling. This "view jail" indicates your content is excellent, but you might be reaching the limits of your current audience or operating in a highly saturated niche.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    At this stage, your videos are likely high-quality, engaging, and well-produced. The challenge isn't the content itself, but rather the size of the potential audience for that specific content or niche. You might have mastered your craft, but the market for it is naturally limited.

                        You've niched down effectively, but the audience for that very specific topic is inherently small. While you might be dominating that micro-niche, there simply aren't millions of people searching for it.

                            <strong>Broaden Slightly:</strong> Can you expand your topic scope without losing your core audience? E.g., from "vintage 1980s Japanese synthesizers" to "vintage synthesizers" or "classic electronic music gear."

                        <li>
